# ⚠️ 1.2-Exceptions  
A complete set of exercises focused on exception handling in Java.  
This project demonstrates how to work with built-in and custom exceptions to build robust and user-friendly applications.

## 📄 Description - Exercise Statement

This repository contains the full solution for **Sprint 1 - Exceptions** of the Java programming track.  
The sprint is divided into three levels, each focusing on more advanced exception management techniques:

### 💥 Level 1  
- Implements a `Producte` and `Venda` class to simulate a sales system.  
- Introduces a custom exception `VendaBuidaException` that is thrown if an attempt is made to calculate a sale with no products.  
- Demonstrates the use and handling of built-in exceptions like `IndexOutOfBoundsException`.

### 🎯 Level 2  
- Provides a utility class `Entrada` with static methods to safely read user input from the console using `Scanner`.  
- Implements error handling with `InputMismatchException` and custom exceptions for invalid character, string, or yes/no input.  
- Ensures the program continuously asks for input until valid data is entered.

### 🎟️ Level 3  
- Simulates a movie theater seat reservation system.  
- Models domain classes such as `Butaca`, `Cine`, `GestioButaques`, and `GestioCine`.  
- Uses custom exceptions like `ExcepcioNomPersonaIncorrecte`, `ExcepcioFilaIncorrecta`, `ExcepcioSeientIncorrecte`, `ExcepcioButacaOcupada`, and `ExcepcioButacaLliure` to enforce data integrity.  
- Includes a complete interactive menu to manage reservations and cancellations.
